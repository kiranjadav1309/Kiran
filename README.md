# Oozie Samples
- This branch has scripts and files that are required to setup your first oozie workflow. 
- Shell scripts does include the workflow submission.
- This workflow of oozie can trigger spark2 submits through SSH action. I did call out in the workflow.xml
- I have not placed any spark submissions, i will try to created different branch to capture spark submits.
